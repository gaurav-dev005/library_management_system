## Project Description
This project is a simple Library Book Management System.
It is developed using an Agile approach and completed in
three sprints.

The system is built using Python and uses in-memory data
structures only. No database is used.

## Tools Used

- unittest
- Git
- github

## Agile Process
The project is divided into three sprints:
- Sprint 1: Book Registration
- Sprint 2: Borrow and Return Book
- Sprint 3: Library Report

Each sprint is developed in a separate Git branch and merged
into the main branch only after all tests pass.
