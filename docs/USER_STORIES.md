# User Stories – Library Book Management System

This document contains user stories implemented sprint-wise
as part of the Agile development process.

## Sprint 1 – Book Registration

US-1.1
As a librarian,  
I want to add a book with a unique Book ID, title, and author,  
So that books can be stored in the library system.

US-1.2 
System should  reject duplicate Book IDs,  
So that each book can be uniquely identified.


## Sprint 2 – Borrow and Return Book

## Sprint 2 – Borrow and Return Book

**US-2.1**  
Borrowing a book and status of book should be marked borrowed

**US-2.2**  
System should prevent borrowing a book that is already borrowed,  
So that incorrect borrowing is avoided.

**US-2.3**  
Return a borrowed book,  
So that the book becomes available again.



## Sprint 3 – Library Report
*(To be implemented)*
